# 42IntraShop

## Why?
Following the 42 subject, it is a simple CRUD app while we don't get the actual real subject, so as a game, how long does it take me to create a simple fullstack app with auth that acthsuallly works?
No good practices, no clean code, but just works. Let's see! Gonna use Nextjs, Express.js and postgres.

## Stopwatch of development

- [x] 1h - Initial Setup
- [x] 1h - Backend basics functionalities
- [x] 2h - Frontend basic functionality
- [x] 1h - First deploy
- [ ] ?h - Auth Frontend / backend
